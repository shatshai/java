# HRApp

## HR App Functionalities:
* Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes Java's encapsulation principles to ensure data integrity and controlled access within the application.
* Polymorphism and Inheritance: Leverages polymorphism and method overriding to create a flexible and extensible framework for managing different HR-related entities (e.g., employees, departments) with shared and specialized behaviors.
* Constructors: Employs constructors to effectively initialize HR objects with necessary data upon creation.
* Object Array Handling: Efficiently interacts with arrays of HR objects, enabling functionalities like managing employee lists, department structures, or other collections of HR-related data.
