# Hello Wold Java on docker

This project demonstrates a simple "Hello World" Java application containerized using Docker. It's a great starting point to learn how to run Java applications within Docker containers.

## Getting Started

* Prerequisites: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can find installation instructions on the official Docker website: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/.

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

## Further Exploration

This project provides a basic example. You can explore further by:
* Modifying the Java code to print a custom message.
* Adding additional dependencies to the Dockerfile.
* Exploring environment variables to configure the application within the container.
